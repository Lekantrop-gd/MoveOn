# Move On! (working project on the "Not-MV-Architecture" branch. MV is in progress :) )
Move On is a simple action game prototype in which you should run away from the cannon that shoots bullets at you. Your goal is to hook onto orbs floating in space to earn points. The objective is to stay in the game as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

### Key features
* **New Input System:**
  This project harnesses the Unity New Input System (NIS) for streamlined player movements. It ensures seamless functionality across all platforms. Explore the [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/index.html) for its powerful capabilities.

* **Post Processing:**
  Utilizing post-processing techniques, the game undergoes a transformation from basic to visually stunning. Dive into the world of post-processing and its impact on game aesthetics by reading [this article](https://medium.com/unity-coder-corner/unity-working-with-post-processing-2d832ed6d82#:~:text=Follow-,Unity%20Coder%20Corner,is%20rendered%20on%20the%20screen).

* **Particle System:**
  The project incorporates Unity's Particle System to create captivating visual effects when the orbs are destroying, adding depth and immersion to the gaming experience.

* **Line Renderer:**
  Employing Unity's Line Renderer component, this game achieves dynamic and smooth line rendering, ideal for visualizing heros' rope.

* **Object Pools:**
  Also I optimized performance with object pooling, efficiently managing and reusing game objects to minimize instantiation and destruction during gameplay. Once again, you can find out more about it by reading [this article](https://thomassteffen.medium.com/advanced-object-pooling-in-c-and-unity-cba2376ad159).

* **DoTween:**
  Enhance animations and transitions with DoTween, a powerful tweening engine for Unity. Check out its capabilities [here](http://dotween.demigiant.com/).
