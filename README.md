# Move On! (working project on the "Not-MV-Architecture" branch. MV is in pregress :) )
Move On is a simple action game prototype in which you should run away from the cannon that shoots bullets at you. Your goal is to hook onto orbs floating in space to earn points. The objective is to stay in the game as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

### Key features
* New Input System. This project uses Unity NIS to route player movements. Basicly, it allows the game to work correctly on the all platforms! That is very powerful thing, so I advide anobody to [take a look at it](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/index.html).
